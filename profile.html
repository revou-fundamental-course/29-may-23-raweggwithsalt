        <h1>About Us</h1> <br>
        <div class="border-bottom"></div>
        <h2>The <font class="spider">Spider Society</font> is a form of charity where we accept donation 
        to help people that cannot afford daily needs, such as food, water, or even educational needs. 
        With the existence of <font class="spider">Spider Society</font>, we hope that we can help those that are in need.
        The concept of <font class="spider">Spider Society</font> is taken by the words said by Mary Jane
        on the animated movie Spiderman : Into the Spiderverse where she mentioned about <font class="spider"> being a hero doesn't mean being Spiderman,
        hero can be anyone, even when we don't have a mask of a hero, we still can act like a hero to help those around us.</font>
        Through this concept, we invite all of you to join the <font class="spider">Spider Society</font> and become the hero to help people.</h2>  <br>
